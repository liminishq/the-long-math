      <h1>Tools and Calculators</h1>

	<p><strong>This page lists the interactive financial calculators available on The Long Math.</strong> These tools help you estimate income tax, project investment growth, adjust for inflation, calculate mortgage costs, measure advisory fees, and compare long-term financial decisions using explicit assumptions and transparent arithmetic.</p>

	<p>Each calculator models a specific financial question over time. Inputs, formulas, and outputs are visible and inspectable. Tools are updated independently and may differ in scope, inputs, and jurisdiction.</p>

	<p>Unlike many online calculators, these tools do not embed hidden assumptions or prepackaged projections. Every result is derived directly from the inputs you provide and the formulas shown on the page — nothing more, nothing less.</p>
