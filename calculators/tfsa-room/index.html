            <p>This tool provides an estimate of your TFSA contribution room based on year-by-year limits and your inputs. Room depends on eligibility (age + residency). If you weren't eligible at 18, adjust the eligibility start year.</p>
            <p>Withdrawals do not create room again until January 1 of the next year.</p>

    <section class="faq-section">
      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How is TFSA contribution room calculated?</h3>
        <p>TFSA contribution room is calculated as the sum of annual TFSA limits for each year you were eligible (starting from the year you turned 18, or 2009 if later), minus all contributions made, plus withdrawals from prior years (which add back to room in the following year). The annual limit varies by year and is set by the Canada Revenue Agency.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do withdrawals increase TFSA room right away?</h3>
        <p>No. Withdrawals from your TFSA do not immediately increase your contribution room. The amount withdrawn is added back to your contribution room starting January 1 of the following year. For example, if you withdraw $10,000 in 2024, that $10,000 is added to your contribution room on January 1, 2025, not in 2024.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What if I immigrated to Canada or wasn't eligible at 18?</h3>
        <p>TFSA eligibility requires both being 18 years old and being a Canadian resident. If you immigrated to Canada after 2009, or if you were a non-resident for any period, you may not have been eligible in the year you turned 18. Use the "Canadian TFSA eligibility start year" field to set the correct first year you were eligible. This is the year you turned 18 AND were a Canadian resident, or 2009 if that was later.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why might this differ from CRA My Account?</h3>
        <p>This calculator is an estimate based on the information you provide. Your actual CRA contribution room may differ due to: timing of contributions and withdrawals (CRA processes transactions as they are reported), corrections or adjustments made by CRA, or incomplete information in your inputs. Always verify your actual contribution room using your CRA My Account statement before making contributions.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What are the annual TFSA contribution room limits by year?</h3>
        <p>The annual TFSA contribution room limit is set by the Canada Revenue Agency and varies by year. The table below shows the contribution room available for each year since the TFSA program began in 2009. This table is updated annually when new limits are announced by CRA.</p>
