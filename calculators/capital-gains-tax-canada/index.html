      <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <details class="faq-accordion-item">
        <summary>What is “Adjusted Cost Base (ACB)”?</summary>
        <div class="faq-accordion-body">
          <p>Adjusted Cost Base (ACB) is generally what you paid to acquire an asset, plus the cost of improvements, minus any returns of capital. For identical properties (e.g., shares of the same stock bought at different times), you must average the cost of all identical units to determine the ACB per unit. ACB is used to calculate your capital gain or loss when you sell.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-accordion-item">
        <summary>What is the capital gains inclusion rate?</summary>
        <div class="faq-accordion-body">
          <p>The capital gains inclusion rate is the percentage of a capital gain that is taxable. In Canada, 50% of a capital gain is typically included in income (the inclusion rate is 50%). This means only half of the gain is added to your taxable income and taxed at your marginal rate. The inclusion rate can change by law; this calculator lets you adjust it.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-accordion-item">
        <summary>What is marginal tax rate?</summary>
        <div class="faq-accordion-body">
          <p>Your marginal tax rate is the rate of tax you pay on your next dollar of taxable income. It combines federal and provincial/territorial rates and rises as income increases. To estimate tax on a capital gain, you apply your marginal rate to the taxable portion of the gain (inclusion rate × gain). You can use the <a href="/longmath-tax-canada-2025/">Canada Personal Income Tax Calculator 2025</a> to help estimate your marginal rate based on your income and province.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-accordion-item">
        <summary>What happens if I have a capital loss?</summary>
        <div class="faq-accordion-body">
          <p>If your proceeds are less than your ACB, you have a capital loss. Capital losses do not reduce tax on a per-sale basis; instead, they can be used to offset capital gains in the same year or carried back or forward to other years under CRA rules. This calculator treats a loss as: taxable gain = 0, tax owing = 0, and after-tax proceeds = proceeds (you keep the full amount you received).</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-accordion-item">
        <summary>Primary residence exemption (educational only)</summary>
        <div class="faq-accordion-body">
          <p>The primary residence exemption can reduce or eliminate tax on a gain from selling your principal home. Real eligibility depends on CRA rules: you generally must have owned and inhabited the property as your principal residence for the years in question, subject to specific conditions and limitations. The toggle in this calculator is for educational illustration only and does not constitute tax advice. Consult CRA guidance or a tax professional to determine your actual eligibility.</p>
