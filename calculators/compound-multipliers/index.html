      <h1>Compound Interest Multipliers</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        Static table of compound interest multipliers using annual compounding.
        Each cell is a growth factor for <strong>(1 + r)<sup>t</sup></strong>, where <strong>r</strong> is the annual rate and <strong>t</strong> is the number of years.
      </p>

      <p>
        The result is a <strong>multiplier</strong>: how many times larger an amount becomes after compounding at a fixed annual rate.
        Multiply any starting amount by the table value to compute its future value.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        <p><strong>How to read this:</strong> A multiplier of 2.00 means “double.” Multiply any starting amount by the multiplier to get the future value.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 18px;">What is a compound interest multiplier?</h2>
      <p>
        A compound interest multiplier is the growth factor produced by <strong>(1 + r)<sup>t</sup></strong>.
        It tells you how many times larger an amount becomes after compounding at a fixed annual rate for a specified number of years.
      </p>

      <h2>How to use this table</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Select an annual rate (left column).</li>
        <li>Move across to the number of years (top row).</li>
        <li>Multiply your starting amount by the multiplier.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Does this include inflation, taxes, or fees?</h2>
      <p>
        No. This is <strong>nominal</strong> growth under annual compounding only.
        It does not account for inflation, taxes on gains, investment fees, or cash flows (contributions and withdrawals).
      </p>

      <h2>Why small rate differences matter</h2>
      <p>
        Compounding is exponential. Small differences in annual rate create modest gaps early on and large gaps over long horizons.
        Time magnifies rate differences.

          <h3>Formula</h3>
          <p>
            Multiplier at year <em>t</em> for annual rate <em>r</em> is:
            <strong>(1 + r)<sup>t</sup></strong>
          </p>

          <h3>Assumptions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Annual compounding once per year.</li>
            <li>No taxes, fees, inflation adjustment, or cash flows (this is a pure multiplier grid).</li>
            <li>Rounded for display; the underlying calculation uses full precision.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>This is intentionally “static”: no scenario modeling, no personalization—just the arithmetic table.</li>
