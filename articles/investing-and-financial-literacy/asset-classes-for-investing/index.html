      <section class="section-card intro-card">
        <p>Most people think investing means "buying stocks." It doesn't.</p>
        <p>Investing means choosing which economic forces you want exposure to. Before you pick an ETF. Before you compare fees. Before you project returns. You are choosing asset classes. Everything else is downstream from that decision.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section-card" id="what-is-asset-class">
        <h2>What Is an Asset Class?</h2>
        <blockquote>
          An asset class is a category of investments that share similar return drivers and risk characteristics.<br>
          The major asset classes are stocks (equities), bonds (fixed income), cash, and real assets such as real estate and commodities.
        </blockquote>
        <p>Asset classes form the foundation of asset allocation. If you are new to investing, you may want to begin with our article on
          <a href="/articles/investing-and-financial-literacy/what-is-investing/">What Is Investing?</a>
          before going deeper into investment categories.</p>
        <p>Each asset class has:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A return driver</li>
          <li>A risk structure</li>
          <li>A role within long-term investing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you understand those three things, investing becomes less emotional and more mechanical.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section-card" id="types-of-asset-classes">
        <h2>Types of Asset Classes (The Four Core Categories)</h2>
      </section>

      <section class="section-card" id="stocks-equities">
        <h2>1) Stocks (Equities)</h2>
        <p>Stocks represent ownership in businesses that trade in the
          <a href="/articles/what-is-the-stock-market/">stock market</a>. When you buy a stock, you own a share of a company.</p>
        <p>If you want a deeper explanation of how shares work, see our article on
          <a href="/articles/what-is-a-stock/">What Is a Stock?</a></p>
        <p>Examples include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Individual company shares</li>
          <li>Broad market ETFs (index funds)</li>
          <li>Equity mutual funds inside retirement accounts (RRSPs, TFSAs, 401(k)s, Roth IRAs)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Return driver:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Earnings growth</li>
          <li>Dividends</li>
          <li>Changes in valuation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Historically, diversified stock markets have returned roughly 8–10% annually over long periods, compared to 4-6% for bonds. That difference may sound modest compared to bonds. It is not.</p>
        <p>$10,000 invested for 30 years:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>At 8% → ~$100,600</li>
          <li>At 5% → ~$43,200</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A 3% return difference more than doubles the ending value.</p>
        <p>Stocks grow through earnings. The long-term return potential is high. But that growth is not linear. The short-term experience can be volatile.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section-card" id="bonds-fixed-income">
        <h2>2) Bonds (Fixed Income)</h2>
        <p>Bonds represent lending. Examples include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Government bonds</li>
          <li>Corporate bonds</li>
          <li>Bond ETFs</li>
          <li>Bond mutual funds</li>
          <li>GICs (Canada)</li>
          <li>CDs (United States)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You provide capital. You receive interest.</p>
        <p><strong>Return driver:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Interest payments</li>
          <li>Changes in bond prices when interest rates move</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Historically, bonds have returned roughly 4–6% annually over long periods. They reduce portfolio volatility. But they introduce inflation risk. If inflation exceeds your yield, real returns shrink.</p>
        <p>If bonds reduce volatility, cash reduces it further. But that introduces another risk.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section-card" id="cash-equivalents">
        <h2>3) Cash and Cash Equivalents</h2>
        <p>Cash includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Savings accounts</li>
          <li>High-interest savings accounts</li>
          <li>Treasury bills</li>
          <li>Money market funds</li>
          <li>Short-term GICs or CDs</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Return driver:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Short-term interest rates set by central banks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Cash appears stable. But nominal stability is not purchasing power stability.</p>
        <p>$100,000 at 2% interest for 20 years grows to ~$149,000. At 3% inflation, its purchasing power falls to roughly what $82,000 buys today. The number grows. The value shrinks.</p>
        <p>We examine this dynamic in more detail in
          <a href="/articles/investing-and-financial-literacy/inflation/">Inflation: The Math That Makes Future Money Smaller</a>.</p>
        <p>Short term: low volatility. Long term: erosion risk.</p>
        <p>Cash prioritizes stability. Real assets reintroduce market risk — often in tangible form.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section-card" id="real-assets">
        <h2>4) Real Assets (Real Estate and Commodities)</h2>
        <p>Real assets are physical assets with economic value. Examples include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Residential rental property</li>
          <li>Commercial real estate</li>
          <li>REITs</li>
          <li>Commodities such as gold or oil</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Return drivers:</strong></p>
        <p>Real estate:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rental income</li>
          <li>Property appreciation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Commodities:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Supply and demand shifts</li>
          <li>Inflation dynamics</li>
          <li>Scarcity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Real assets are often purchased using leverage — borrowed money that increases exposure to price movements.<br>Leverage amplifies gains. It also amplifies losses.</p>

        <p>Small return differences compound dramatically over decades. Large drawdowns change timing risk. Both matter for asset allocation.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section-card" id="why-asset-classes-matter">
        <h2>Why Asset Classes Matter for Asset Allocation</h2>
        <p>Different asset classes respond differently to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Economic growth</li>
          <li>Inflation</li>
          <li>Interest rates</li>
          <li>Financial stress</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Stocks may struggle in recessions. Bonds may struggle in inflation spikes. Cash may quietly lose ground over decades.</p>
        <p>Consider a stock-heavy portfolio that declines 30%. A $1,000,000 portfolio becomes $700,000.</p>
        <p>If that decline happens 15 years before retirement, recovery may be manageable. If it happens six months before retirement, the outcome is different.</p>
        <p>Volatility is not abstract. Timing converts volatility into consequence.</p>
        <p>Diversification does not eliminate risk. It changes which risk you are exposed to — and when it appears.</p>
