        <h2>The Problem Most Plans Don't Model</h2>
        <p>Everyone conceptually grasps inflation.</p>
        <p>It's 2%. Maybe 3%. Some years, 6%. Prices go up. Money buys less.</p>
        <p>You've already factored it in.<br>
        Or at least you think you have.</p>
        <p>Since 1960, the long-term average inflation rate in Canada and the United States has been 3.75% per year. (<a href="/tools/inflation-tables/" style="color: var(--accent);">Full CPI dataset.</a>)</p>
        <p>At 3.75% inflation, purchasing power is cut in half over 20 years.</p>
        <p>Cut in half.</p>
        <p>That means $1,000,000 saved today has the buying power of about $500,000 in two decades.</p>
        <p>This is not a stress scenario. It is the long-term average.</p>
        <p>Most financial plans model returns.<br>
        Many model fees.<br>
        Few model what inflation does over decades.</p>
        <p>If you are building long-term projections in nominal dollars, the math is already wrong.</p>
        <p>Inflation is not optional. It must be modeled.</p>
        <p>This article shows the arithmetic.</p>
	<p>No opinions. No hidden assumptions. <strong>Just arithmetic.</strong></p>
      </section>

      <section class="section-card">
        <h2>Inflation Is Exponential</h2>
        <p>Compounding grows a number by repeatedly multiplying by the same factor.</p>
        <p>Inflation is exponential, not linear.</p>
        <p>At 3.75% growth: <span style="color: var(--accent);">1 × 1.0375^20 ≈ 2.09</span></p>
        <p>At 3.75% inflation: <span style="color: var(--accent);">1 ÷ 1.0375^20 ≈ 0.48</span></p>
        <p>After 20 years at 3.75% inflation, $1 has roughly half the purchasing power it has today.</p>
        <p>Same math. Opposite direction.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section-card">
        <h2>What Inflation Is</h2>
        <p>Inflation is the sustained rise in the general price level over time.</p>
        <p>When prices rise, each dollar buys fewer goods and services than it did previously.</p>
        <p>Inflation does not reduce the number of dollars you hold.<br>
        It reduces what those dollars can purchase.</p>
        <p>That distinction matters.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section-card">
        <h2>The Core Equation</h2>
        <p>There are two calculations that matter.</p>
        <h3>1. Future Cost of Today's Dollars</h3>
        <p><span style="color: var(--accent);">Future Cost = Cost Today × (1 + i)^t</span></p>
        <p>Where i is the inflation rate and t is time in years.</p>
        <p>This tells you what today's lifestyle costs in future dollars.</p>
        <h3>2. Present Value of Future Dollars</h3>
        <p><span style="color: var(--accent);">Present Value = Future Dollars ÷ (1 + i)^t</span></p>
        <p>This tells you what future dollars are worth in today's purchasing power.</p>
        <p>Everything else follows from these two equations.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section-card">
        <h2>A Concrete Example: Retirement Income</h2>
        <p>Suppose you want $10,000 per month in today's dollars in retirement.</p>
        <p>If inflation averages 3.75% and retirement begins 20 years from now:</p>
        <p><span style="color: var(--accent);">10,000 × 1.0375^20 ≈ 20,900</span></p>
        <p>That same lifestyle requires about $20,900 per month in 20-year dollars.</p>
        <p>The number doubled because prices doubled.</p>
        <p>The lifestyle did not change.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section-card">
        <h2>A Second Example: The Portfolio Target</h2>
        <p>Assume you believe you need $3,000,000 in today's dollars to retire.</p>
        <p>If retirement is 20 years away:</p>
        <p><span style="color: var(--accent);">3,000,000 × 1.0375^20 ≈ 6,270,000</span></p>
        <p>A "$3 million retirement target" becomes roughly $6.3 million in 20-year dollars.</p>
        <p>The original $3 million was correct — in today's dollars.</p>
        <p>Failing to inflate it does not make it more achievable.<br>
        It only makes the math wrong.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section-card">
        <h2>Nominal vs Real Returns</h2>
        <p>Investment returns are quoted in nominal terms.</p>
        <p>What matters is real return — return after inflation.</p>
        <p><span style="color: var(--accent);">1 + r_real = (1 + r_nominal) ÷ (1 + i)</span></p>
        <p>If your portfolio earns 7% and inflation is 3.75%:</p>
        <p><span style="color: var(--accent);">1.07 ÷ 1.0375 − 1 ≈ 3.13%</span></p>
        <p>Your statement shows 7% growth.<br>
        Purchasing power grows at 3.13%.</p>
        <p>Over decades, that difference dominates outcomes.</p>

        <h2>Final Framing</h2>
        <p>Inflation is not dramatic.<br>
        Its effects are.</p>
        <p>It does not cause sudden collapse.<br>
        It causes gradual distortion.</p>
        <p>Plans built in nominal dollars create false confidence.<br>
        Targets set without inflation drift from reality.<br>
        Returns quoted without inflation adjustment mislead.</p>
        <p>Over long periods, small annual differences become large structural errors.</p>
        <p>Inflation compounds whether you account for it or not.</p>
        <p>You can ignore it.<br>
        You cannot escape it.</p>
        <p>If your savings compound faster than inflation, purchasing power rises.<br>
        If they compound more slowly, purchasing power falls.</p>
        <p>There is no opinion in that statement.<br>
        No hidden assumptions.<br>
