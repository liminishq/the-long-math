        <p>A stock is partial ownership in a company.</p>
        <p>When you buy a stock, you are buying a small piece of a real business. That ownership gives you a proportional claim on the company's assets and future profits.</p>
        <p>If you plan to invest, you should understand exactly what you own.</p>
        <p>If you buy 100 shares of a company with 1,000,000 shares outstanding, you own 0.01% of the business — whether the stock price rises or falls tomorrow.</p>
        <p><strong>No opinions.  No hidden assumptions.  Just arithmetic.</strong></p>
      </section>

      <section class="section-card">
        <h2>What Does Owning a Stock Mean?</h2>
        <p>If a company has 1,000,000 shares outstanding and you own 1,000 shares:</p>
        <p><div class="lm-formula">1,000 / 1,000,000 = 0.1%</div></p>
        <p>You own 0.1% of the business.</p>
        <p>That percentage represents a proportional claim on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Company assets</li>
          <li>Company earnings</li>
          <li>Future growth</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ownership is not symbolic.<br>
        It is mathematical.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section-card">
        <h2>What Is a Share of Stock?</h2>
        <p>A share is a unit of ownership in a company.</p>
        <p>Companies divide ownership into shares so they can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Raise capital</li>
          <li>Transfer ownership efficiently</li>
          <li>Create liquidity through public markets</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The number of shares outstanding determines how ownership is divided.</p>
        <p>If total company value is: $100,000,000</p>
        <p>And there are: 1,000,000 shares</p>
        <p><div class="lm-formula">$100,000,000 / 1,000,000 = $100 per share</div></p>
        <p>Stock price reflects total company value divided by total shares outstanding.</p>
        <p>This is how stocks work at the most basic level.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section-card">
        <h2>How Do Stocks Make Money?</h2>
        <p>Stocks generate returns in two ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Price appreciation</li>
          <li>Dividends</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All stock returns ultimately reduce to those two sources.</p>
        <h3>1. Price Appreciation</h3>
        <p>If you buy at $50 and sell at $70:</p>
        <p><div class="lm-formula">$70 - $50 = $20</div></p>
        <p>That $20 difference is a capital gain.</p>
        <p>Stock prices rise when investors believe the company's future earnings will increase.</p>
        <p>Prices move because expectations change.</p>
        <p>The mechanism is supply and demand.<br>
        The driver is expected future cash flow.</p>
        <p>Markets do not price the past.<br>
        They price the future.</p>
        <h3>2. Dividends</h3>
        <p>Some companies distribute a portion of their profits directly to shareholders called dividends.</p>
        <p>If a company pays $2 per share annually and you own 100 shares:</p>
        <p><div class="lm-formula">100 × 2 = $200</div></p>
        <p>You receive $200 in cash.<br>
        You still own the shares.</p>
        <p>Dividends are direct cash returns from company profits.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section-card">
        <h2>How Dividends Affect Stock Price</h2>
        <p>Dividends do not create new value.<br>
        They redistribute existing value.</p>
        <p>Using the earlier example:</p>
        <p>Company value: $100,000,000<br>
        Shares outstanding: 1,000,000<br>
        Share price: $100</p>
        <p>If the company pays $2 per share:</p>
        <p><div class="lm-formula">2 × 1,000,000 = $2,000,000</div></p>
        <p>The company distributes $2,000,000 in cash.</p>
        <p>New company value:</p>
        <p><div class="lm-formula">$100,000,000 - $2,000,000 = $98,000,000</div></p>
        <p>New share price:</p>
        <p><div class="lm-formula">$98,000,000 / 1,000,000 = $98</div></p>
        <p>After the dividend:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You own shares worth approximately $98 each</li>
          <li>You received $2 per share in cash</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Total economic value remains unchanged.</p>
        <p>Dividends are not extra money.<br>
        They are part of your ownership being returned to you.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section-card">
        <h2>The Difference Between a Company and Its Stock Price</h2>
        <p>A company produces goods or services.</p>
        <p>A stock price reflects what investors believe that company is worth today based on current assets and debts, and expected future profits.</p>
        <p>Stock prices reflect:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Expected future earnings</li>
          <li>An adjustment factor for what those future earnings are worth today</li>
          <li>Continuous updating as new information arrives</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The business may be stable.<br>
        The stock price may not be.</p>
        <p>Business performance and market valuation are related — but not identical.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section-card">
        <h2>Why Do Stock Prices Go Up and Down?</h2>
        <p>Stock prices change when expectations change.</p>
        <p>Common drivers include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Earnings reports</li>
          <li>Interest rate changes</li>
          <li>Economic conditions</li>
          <li>Industry developments</li>
          <li>Investor sentiment</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Stock prices reflect what investors think the company will earn in the future, translated into today’s dollars.</p>
        <p>Markets continuously update those expectations.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section-card">
        <h2>Are Stocks Risky?</h2>
        <p>Stocks are not guaranteed.<br>
        Prices fluctuate daily.<br>
        Short-term volatility can be significant.</p>
        <p>A stock can decline 30–50% in a single year and still represent ownership in a viable business.</p>
        <p>Long-term returns depend on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Earnings growth</li>
          <li>Reinvestment of profits</li>
          <li>Competitive advantage</li>
          <li>Time</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Over long periods, compounding becomes the dominant force.</p>
        <p>Time reduces the impact of short-term noise.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section-card">
        <h2>Stocks as an Asset Class</h2>
        <p>Stocks are one of several major asset classes.</p>
        <p>Other asset classes include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bonds</li>
          <li>Real estate</li>
          <li>Cash</li>
          <li>Commodities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each asset class behaves differently in terms of risk and return.</p>
        <p>Historically, stocks have produced higher long-term returns than cash or bonds — with greater volatility.</p>
        <p>Higher expected return is compensation for bearing risk.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section-card">
        <h2>What Is the Stock Market?</h2>
        <p>Stocks are bought and sold on exchanges.<br>
        These exchanges form the stock market.<br>
        The stock market does not create value.</p>
        <p>It is the marketplace where buyers and sellers transfer ownership at agreed-upon prices.</p>
        <p>The company creates value.<br>
        The market assigns a price.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section-card">
        <h2>Summary: What Is a Stock?</h2>
        <p>A stock is partial ownership in a company.</p>
        <p>It gives you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A proportional claim on assets</li>
          <li>A proportional claim on profits</li>
          <li>Exposure to future growth</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Stocks generate returns through:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Price appreciation</li>
          <li>Dividends</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The arithmetic is simple.<br>
        The results follow the arithmetic.</p>
