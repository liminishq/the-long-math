      <h1>What Is a Stock? (In Simple Terms)</h1>

      <p><strong>A stock is partial ownership in a company.</strong></p>

      <p>When you buy a stock, you are buying a small piece of a real business. That ownership gives you a proportional claim on the company’s assets and future profits.</p>

      <p>If you plan to invest, you should understand exactly what you own.</p>

      <p><em>No opinions. No hidden assumptions. Just arithmetic.</em></p>

      <h2>What Does Owning a Stock Mean?</h2>

      <p>Owning a stock means you own a fraction of a company.</p>

      <p>If a company has 1,000,000 shares outstanding and you own 1,000 shares:</p>

      <pre><code>1,000 / 1,000,000 = 0.1%</code></pre>

      <p>You own 0.1% of the business.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Company assets</li>
        <li>Company earnings</li>
        <li>Future growth</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Ownership is mathematical.</p>

      <h2>What Is a Share of Stock?</h2>

      <p>A share is a unit of ownership in a company.</p>

      <p>If total company value is: $100,000,000<br>
      And there are: 1,000,000 shares</p>

      <pre><code>$100,000,000 / 1,000,000 = $100 per share</code></pre>

      <p>Stock price reflects total company value divided by shares outstanding.</p>

      <h2>How Do Stocks Make Money?</h2>

      <p>Stocks generate returns in two ways:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Price appreciation</li>
        <li>Dividends</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>1. Price Appreciation</h3>

      <p>If you buy at $50 and sell at $70:</p>

      <pre><code>$70 - $50 = $20</code></pre>

      <p>This is a capital gain.</p>

      <h3>2. Dividends</h3>

      <p>Some companies distribute a portion of their profits directly to shareholders called dividends.</p>

      <p>If a company pays $2 per share annually and you own 100 shares:</p>

      <pre><code>100 × 2 = $200</code></pre>

      <p>You receive $200 in cash and still own the shares.</p>

      <h2>How Dividends Affect Stock Price</h2>

      <p>Dividends redistribute existing value.</p>

      <p>If a $100,000,000 company pays $2 per share across 1,000,000 shares:</p>

      <pre><code>2 × 1,000,000 = $2,000,000</code></pre>

      <p>New company value becomes $98,000,000.</p>

      <pre><code>$98,000,000 / 1,000,000 = $98 per share</code></pre>

      <p>Total economic value remains unchanged.</p>

      <h2>Why Do Stock Prices Go Up and Down?</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Earnings reports</li>
        <li>Interest rate changes</li>
        <li>Economic conditions</li>
        <li>Investor expectations</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Stock prices reflect the present value of expected future cash flows.</p>

      <h2>Are Stocks Risky?</h2>

      <p>Stocks fluctuate. Short-term volatility can be significant.</p>

      <p>Long-term returns depend on growth, reinvestment, and time.</p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>

      <p>A stock is partial ownership in a company.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Claim on assets</li>
        <li>Claim on profits</li>
        <li>Exposure to future growth</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Stocks generate returns through price appreciation and dividends.</p>

      <p>The arithmetic is simple. The discipline is not.</p>
