        <h1>What Is the Stock Market?</h1>
      </header>

      <p class="definition-block">In simple terms, the stock market is a system where investors buy and sell ownership shares in publicly traded companies. It works by matching buyers and sellers who agree on a price for partial ownership in a business. Over time, stock prices reflect changes in business performance and investor expectations.</p>

      <h2 id="what-is-a-stock">What Is a Stock and How Does It Represent Ownership?</h2>
      <p>A stock is a share of ownership in a company. When you buy a share, you own a small piece of that business. The stock market is where those shares are traded: investors who want to buy are matched with investors who want to sell.</p>
      <p>Ownership is usually expressed in shares. One share is one unit of part-ownership. If a company has issued one million shares and you own one thousand, you have a part-ownership stake proportional to that. You don't run the company, but you have a claim on a fraction of its value and, in many cases, a share of profits paid out as dividends.</p>

      <h2 id="why-prices-move">Why Do Stock Prices Move? Price vs. Value Explained</h2>
      <p>Stock prices change because buyers and sellers constantly reassess what they're willing to pay or accept. The stock market doesn't announce one "true" value; it reflects the latest agreed price between a buyer and a seller.</p>
      <p>Price is what you pay today. Value is what you believe the company is worth over time—its future earnings, assets, and growth. When expectations about a company's future improve, more people want to buy and the price tends to rise. When expectations worsen, selling pressure can push the price down. So prices move as investors update their views on business performance and risk.</p>

      <h2 id="why-markets-grow">Why Does the Stock Market Grow Over Time?</h2>
      <p>Over long periods, the stock market can go up when the companies in it grow. Businesses that earn profits and reinvest them can become more valuable. As their earnings grow, the part-ownership stakes (shares) can become worth more, so the broad market can trend upward over time.</p>
      <p>That doesn't mean every stock or every year is positive. Individual companies can fail; the market can fall in any given year. Over many years, though, the stock market has tended to reflect the growth of the economy and of corporate earnings. Inflation and fees can reduce your real return; we mention them only to acknowledge they exist—details are covered elsewhere on the site.</p>
