  <h1>About</h1>

  <h2>What this site is</h2>

  <p><strong>The Long Math</strong> is a collection of tools and explanations designed to make long-term financial trade-offs easier to see.</p>

  <p>
    Many financial decisions are discussed through stories — delivered as conventional guidance, reassurances of expertise,
    or promises of success. This site approaches those same decisions through <strong>arithmetic</strong>.
    It focuses on how fees, taxes, compounding, and incentives interact over long time horizons, using explicit assumptions
    and calculations that can be inspected directly.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal is not to persuade, but to inform. This site makes the math visible, enabling users to make their own decisions
    based on quantifiable measures rather than narratives.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>What this site is not</h2>

  <p>
    This site does <strong>not</strong> provide financial advice or recommendations. The tools do not tell users what to do,
    optimize for outcomes, or steer decisions toward particular strategies or products.
    They are built to show how inputs relate to outputs, not to label choices as correct or incorrect.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some decisions may feel clearer after seeing the numbers; others may feel more complex.
    Either way, the arithmetic is explicit.
  </p>

  <p>
    This work may expand over time through additional tools or written material.
    Such extensions <strong>do not and cannot</strong> change how the calculations behave.
    The arithmetic remains objective and unaltered.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Why arithmetic matters</h2>

  <p>
    Disagreements about financial decisions often arise from hidden assumptions rather than from the math itself.
    When inputs like time horizon, fees, or tax treatment are explicit, disagreement becomes inspectable.
  </p>

  <p>
    Arithmetic does not resolve every decision, but it makes trade-offs harder to ignore and easier to evaluate.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>How the tools are built</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Inputs are explicit and user-controlled.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Assumptions are stated plainly.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Outputs follow directly from inputs.</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The tools are designed to be understandable rather than impressive.
    If a result depends on an assumption, that dependence is visible.
  </p>

  <h2>Why this is being shared</h2>

  <p>
    This began as an attempt to validity-test my own long-term financial decisions using explicit math rather than narratives.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many of my early financial choices were influenced by those stories — delivered as conventional guidance,
    reassurances of expertise, or promises of success — rather than by clear arithmetic.
    Over time, the consistency of the results, and how often they diverged from common explanations,
    suggested the calculations were worth sharing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many financial decisions carry consequences that compound quietly.
    <strong>The Long Math</strong> exists to make those dynamics easier to inspect earlier,
    before decisions are locked in.
  </p>
The Long Math does not offer answers.  It offers visibility.  It lets the numbers replace the stories.

  <p><strong>No opinions.</strong><br>
     <strong>No hidden assumptions.</strong><br>
     <strong>Just arithmetic.</strong>
