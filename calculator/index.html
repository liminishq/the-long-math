      <h1>The True Calculated Cost of a Financial Advisor (AUM Model)</h1>

      <div class="lede">
        <p>Many financial advisors charge fees as a percentage of the assets they manage.</p>

        <p>
          Advisors may also recommend or sell investment products (including mutual funds and ETFs) that carry additional management expenses, which further reduce net investment returns over time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over long time horizons, the true cost of this fee structure is not limited to the fees paid. It also includes the opportunity cost of no longer being able to compound those fees over time.
        </p>

        <p>
          This calculator accounts for both components — direct fees and lost compounding — to estimate the true long-term cost of using an advisor with an assets-under-management (AUM) fee structure.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rarely, advisors may charge flat annual fees or hourly fees instead of percentage-based AUM fees. Because these fees do not scale with portfolio size, they are usually arithmetically less costly over time. A calculator outlining these fee structures is available
          <a href="/calculators/flat-fee-or-hourly/" class="inline-link">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p><strong>No opinions. No hidden assumptions. Just arithmetic.</strong></p>

        <strong>Product costs (MER)</strong>
        <div>
          MER is the Management Expense Ratio. It is the fee charged by each individual mutual fund to cover trading fees, salaries,
          and other expenses of their fund managers. When enabled, the MER is applied to invested assets in addition to advisory fees.
          <br><br>
          MER is usually charged in addition to any fees your advisor would charge, causing further fee drag on investment returns.
          Occasionally, your advisor’s fee may be partially embedded within the MER of a product they sell you. MERs can vary significantly—usually
          between 2–6% for mutual funds—but are much less expensive for ETFs, often &lt;0.3%.
          <br><br>
          We assume 2% in this calculator by default. Please adjust accordingly based on your own investment portfolio.
          <br><br>
          <span class="inline-note"><strong>Note:</strong> MER meaningfully changes outcomes. Careful consideration is required to determine true calculated costs in your specific case.</span>

          The average annual return required for an advisor-managed portfolio to produce the same ending value as the non-advisor case,
          using the assumptions you selected.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Example:</strong>
          The "Starting out" scenario assumes a 7% return on your portfolio over time. If this same portfolio were managed by an advisor,
          using the default fee schedule plus the assumed 2% MER, the advisor would need to obtain a 10.71% annual return to break even
          with an unmanaged (and MER-free) portfolio returning 7% annually. If you applied the default advisor fee schedule but de-selected MER
          (appropriate for a portfolio containing no mutual funds/ETFs/other managed products), the portfolio must return 8.65% annually to break even
          with an identical unmanaged portfolio.
