      <h1>The True Calculated Cost of a Financial Advisor</h1>

      <div class="lede">
        <p>Many financial advisors charge fees as a percentage of the assets they manage.</p>

        <p>
          Advisors may also recommend or sell investment products (including mutual funds and ETFs)
          that carry additional management expenses, which further reduce net investment returns over time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over long time horizons, the cost of this fee structure is not limited to the fees paid.
          It also includes the opportunity cost of no longer being able to compound those fees over time.
        </p>

        <p>
          This calculator accounts for <strong>both</strong> components — direct fees and lost compounding —
          to estimate the true long-term cost of using an advisor with an AUM fee structure.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rarely, advisors may charge hourly fees or flat annual management fees in lieu of AUM percentages.
          The true calculated cost of this service is usually arithmetically superior for the investor.
          A calculator outlining these costs is available <a href="#" style="color:var(--accent)">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p><strong>No opinions. No hidden assumptions. Just arithmetic.</strong></p>
