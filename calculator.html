      <h1>The True Calculated Cost of a Financial Advisor</h1>

      <div class="lede">
        <p>Many financial advisors charge fees as a percentage of the assets they manage.</p>

        <p>
          Advisors may also recommend/sell you investment products (including mutual funds and ETFs) that carry additional management expenses,
          which further reduce net investment returns over time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over long time horizons, the cost of this fee structure is not limited to the fees paid. It also includes the opportunity cost of no longer
          being able to compound those fees over time.
        </p>

        <p>
          This calculator accounts for <strong>both</strong> components — direct fees and lost compounding — to estimate the true long-term cost of using an advisor with an AUM fee structure.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rarely, advisors may charge hourly fees or flat annual management fees in lieu of AUM percentages. The true calculated cost of this service is usually arithmetically superior for the investor. A calculator outlining these costs is available <a class="inline-link" href="#">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p><strong>No opinions. No hidden assumptions. Just arithmetic.</strong></p>

            <strong>Product costs (MER)</strong>
            <div>
              MER is the Management Expense Ratio. It is the fee charged by each individual mutual fund to cover trading fees,
              salaries, and other expenses of their fund managers. When enabled, the MER is applied to invested assets in addition
              to advisory fees.
              <br><br>
              MER is usually charged in addition to any fees your advisor would charge, causing further fee drag on investment
              returns. Occasionally, your advisor's fee may be partially embedded within the MER of a product they sell you.
              MERs can vary significantly—usually between 2–6% for mutual funds—but are much less expensive for ETFs, often
              &lt;0.3%.
              <br><br>
              We assume 2% in this calculator by default. Please adjust accordingly based on your own investment portfolio.
              <br><br>
              <strong style="display:inline; font-weight:800;">Note:</strong> MER meaningfully changes outcomes. Careful consideration is required to determine true calculated costs in your specific case.

              The average annual return required for an advisor-managed portfolio to produce the same ending value as the non-advisor case,
              using the assumptions you selected.
              <br><br>
              <strong style="display:inline; font-weight:800;">Example:</strong>
              The "Starting out" scenario assumes a 7% return on your portfolio over time. If this same portfolio were managed by an advisor,
              using the default fee schedule plus the assumed 2% MER, the advisor would need to obtain a 10.71% annual return to break even
              with an unmanaged (and MER-free) portfolio returning 7% annually.
              If you applied the default advisor fee schedule but de-selected MER (appropriate for a portfolio containing no mutual funds/ETFs/other managed products),
              the portfolio must return 8.65% annually to break even with an identical unmanaged portfolio.
