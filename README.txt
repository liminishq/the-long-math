The Long Math

$ = P(1 + r/n)^nt
No opinions. No hidden assumptions. Just arithmetic.

Executive Summary

The Long Math is a financial decision infrastructure platform focused on long-term trade-offs.

It builds transparent, inspectable calculation tools that quantify:

Compounding effects

Fee drag

Tax friction

Opportunity cost

Inflation-adjusted outcomes

The platform’s premise is simple:

Most financial decisions are arithmetic problems.
Most financial tools obscure the arithmetic.

The Long Math makes it explicit.

Problem

Retail financial tools often:

Hide assumptions

Oversimplify compounding

Blur nominal vs real returns

Ignore opportunity cost

Present outputs without methodological transparency

This creates structural misunderstandings that compound over time.

Solution

The Long Math provides:

Deterministic, client-side financial calculators

Explicit assumption disclosure

Methodology transparency

Inflation-aware modeling

Cash-flow-neutral comparison frameworks

Each tool is designed to make long-term trade-offs visible and measurable.

The platform emphasizes arithmetic clarity over persuasion.

Product Architecture

Stack

Static site architecture

Vanilla JavaScript

Modular calculator pattern (engine + UI separation)

GitHub version control

Cloudflare Pages deployment

No backend. No hidden APIs. No opaque computation.

All calculations are client-side and inspectable.

Calculator Framework

Each calculator follows a standardized structure:

/calculators/
  /tool-name/
    index.html
    engine.js
    ui.js
    styles.css


engine.js

Pure arithmetic logic

Deterministic functions

No UI logic

ui.js

Input parsing

Output formatting

DOM interaction

This structure enables:

Auditability

Modularity

Rapid tool expansion

Clear separation between math and presentation

Strategic Positioning

The Long Math is not:

A brokerage

A robo-advisor

A lead-generation site

An affiliate arbitrage play

It is decision infrastructure.

The long-term vision is to build a structured library of transparent financial tools that become:

Reference-grade

Search-visible

Trust-oriented

Architecturally consistent

Current Scope

The platform currently includes tools such as:

Inflation-adjustable investment compounding models

Mortgage vs invest (cash-flow neutral) comparison tools

Fee impact and advisory cost models

Canada-specific tax calculators

Contribution room calculators

Each tool adheres to an arithmetic-first philosophy.

Design Principles

Inspectable arithmetic

Explicit assumptions

Real vs nominal clarity

Opportunity cost visibility

No embedded persuasion

Outputs are structured to educate, not influence.

Distribution & Deployment

Source of truth: GitHub

Continuous deployment: Cloudflare Pages

Structured data (JSON-LD) for search visibility

Sitemap-driven indexing

The site is designed for long-term SEO durability through utility-driven search demand.

Founder

Phil Evans
Ontario, Canada

“As a high-income professional with no formal training in the financial industry, I found the system lacked transparency for end users. It was structured around narratives rather than numbers. I ran the math myself. The math didn’t justify the structure. I built tools to cut through the narrative and make decisions based on objective data.”
